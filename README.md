## Project Overview

The Casting Agency API is designed to help manage movies and actors within a casting agency. The API allows different users with varying roles to perform different actions. These roles include Casting Assistant, Casting Director, and Executive Producer, each with specific permissions and access rights. This project demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC) using Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-JWT-Extended.

## Motivation for the Project

The primary motivation behind this project is to create a streamlined system that helps a casting agency manage its data efficiently. By implementing role-based access control, we ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions, thus securing sensitive data while allowing necessary operations.

## Hosted API

The API is hosted at: [www.heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
